## Tests

This project's tests are powered by `jest`. To see installation instructions for `jest` refer to the Install section. 

To run all tests to ensure employee classes are working, navigate to the `Develop` directory and type in the command:
```
npm test
```
To ensure that the tests run with the highest verbosity and speed, ensure in the `package.json` File that the 'sripts'>'test' attribute has the following:
